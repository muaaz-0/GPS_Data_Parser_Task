CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory C:/Users/92335/Desktop/GPS_Data_Parser_Task/GPS_data_parser/build/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory c:/Users/92335/Desktop/COWLAR_TASK/GPS_data_parser/build where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "C:/Users/92335/Desktop/GPS_Data_Parser_Task/GPS_data_parser/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "C:/Users/92335/Desktop/COWLAR_TASK/GPS_data_parser/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
